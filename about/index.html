        <p>NashBitDevs is inspired by the original <a href="https://bitdevs.org">BitDevs NYC</a> to
help grow a community in the Nashville area of those interested in discussing
and participating in the research and development of Bitcoin and related
protocols and software. You can be well versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome.
Be advised: discussion will be technical.</p>
<h3 id="socratic-seminars">Socratic Seminars</h3>
<p>Our monthly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Socratic_seminar">Socratic Seminar</a> events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: pull requests
in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, Joinmarket,
Elements Alpha and Electrum), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs,
network monitors and more. To complete the meeting, members present open source
projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&amp;A
section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to
socialize.</p>
<p>An event page will be posted on this site prior to the meetup which outlines discussion topics.
Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event
descriptions of past meetups and on this web site. The discussion portion of
the event is NEVER recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of
the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.</p>
<p>Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at a future Socratic
event or have a recommended topic for discussion: <code>contact @ nashbitdevs.org</code> or find the PR on the
<a href="https://github.com/NashBitDevs/nashbitdevs.org/">nashbitdevs.org github repo</a> and add a comment.
There are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the project. Check our
list of suggestions for <a href="/about/find-topics">where to find topics</a> for future seminars.</p>
